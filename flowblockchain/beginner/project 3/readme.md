The name of my contract is CryptoPoops and it creates NFTs called CryptoPoops. It has input; name,favorite food and lucky number. 
It has two transactions to mint Cryptopoops and create a collection the Cryptopoops will be contained in.
It has two scripts, which are get ids and view NFTs will allow you to get the specific id of the NFT and view the whole data of the NFT respectively.
The burrowAuthNFT function allows you to get the actual NFT and you don't own the NFT, a panic will show "you don't own this NFT"
