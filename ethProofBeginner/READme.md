# Ruttercoin (RTC) Smart Contract

Overview
This repository contains the Solidity smart contract for Ruttercoin (RTC), a basic cryptocurrency token. The smart contract defines the token's name, abbreviation, total supply, and provides functions for minting and burning tokens.

## Contract Details
Token Name: Ruttercoin
Token Abbreviation: RTC
Initial Total Supply: 0
## Functions
## Minting Tokens

The mint function allows the creation of new tokens and assigns them to a specific Ethereum address.

Function Signature: function mint(address _address, uint _amount) public
Parameters:
_address: The Ethereum address to which the tokens will be assigned.
_amount: The amount of tokens to mint and assign to the address.
## Burning Tokens
The burn function allows the destruction of tokens held by a specific Ethereum address.

Function Signature: function burn(address _address, uint _amount) public
Parameters:
_address: The Ethereum address from which the tokens will be burned.
_amount: The amount of tokens to burn from the address.
## Usage
To interact with the Ruttercoin (RTC) smart contract, you can deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. After deployment, you can call the mint and burn functions to manage the token supply.

## License
This smart contract is released under the MIT License. You can find the full license details in the contract code (SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT).

## Important Note

This smart contract is a basic example and lacks several features commonly found in real-world cryptocurrency tokens, such as transfer functions, events, and access control mechanisms. It is recommended to carefully design and test a cryptocurrency contract to ensure its security and functionality.

For more advanced token contracts, consider consulting with blockchain development experts or using established token standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721.
